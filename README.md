Welcome to my hello world project. In this project, I am trying to do a hello world script. 
I was wondering what would be the right language to try to do this. To narrow down the language, I came up with an idea of the features that I would like to test. 

The Hello World Program would help me to
- Check in and check out code from command line in Mac.
- After that, I would like to integrate it with an IDE
- Finally, I would like to learn how to branch and merge code both via command line and IDE.
